### ðŸŸ¢ What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation due to its extensive libraries and community support.

### ðŸŸ¢ Installing Python & Setting Up an IDE
To start coding in Python, you need to install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, setting up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook can help streamline your development process. The Python package manager (pip) is also useful for installing external libraries and dependencies.
***
### ðŸŸ¢ Running Python Programs
Python programs can be executed in multiple ways: using an interactive shell (Python REPL), running scripts from the command line, or using an IDE. The Python interpreter processes the code and executes it line by line.
***
### ðŸŸ¢ Writing Your First Python Program
A basic Python program consists of simple statements. To print 'Hello, World!' in Python, you can write the following code:

```diff
-            print("Hello, World!")
```
This statement uses Pythonâ€™s built-in print() function to display text output.
***
### ðŸŸ¢ Comments in Python
Comments help explain code and make it more readable. In Python, comments start with a # symbol:

```diff
+           # This is a single-line comment
            print("Comments make code easier to understand")
```
Multi-line comments can be written using triple quotes (''' or """). While Python ignores comments during execution, they are essential for documentation and collaboration.
