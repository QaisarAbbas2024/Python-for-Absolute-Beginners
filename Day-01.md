### What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation due to its extensive libraries and community support.

### Installing Python & Setting Up an IDE
To start coding in Python, you need to install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, setting up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook can help streamline your development process. The Python package manager (pip) is also useful for installing external libraries and dependencies.
